# FaceTracker README
# Overview
This Python project produces real-time face detection through a webcam feed. Upon detecting a face in the video stream, the script captures frames and saves them as individual images with timestamps. Additionally, it provides functionality to compile these images into a video file.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x, OpenCV

# Installation
1) Install OpenCV using the following command "pip install opencv-python"
2) Ensure the Haar Cascade XML file ("haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml") is in the same directory as the script.

# Usage
1) Clone the repository or download the FaceRecognition.py script along with the Haar Cascade XML file.
2) Ensure both files are in the same working directory.
3) Follow on-screen instructions to interact with the program.

Happy face detecting! ðŸ“·ðŸ˜Š
